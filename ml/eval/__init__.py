PR 162 — model-eval primitives.

Trainer-facing evaluation layer separate from the full strategy
backtester in ``ml/backtest/``. Trainers call these functions to
compute Sharpe, drawdown, Calmar, win-rate, profit-factor, and benchmark-
relative metrics on a per-fold basis. The promote gate (PR 167) reads
the aggregated values to decide whether ``is_prod=TRUE`` is allowed.

The full backtester engine (`ml/backtest/engine.py`) handles strategy
simulation with slippage/brokerage/STT and is used outside of training
(scanner-lab walk-throughs, manual user backtests). This module is
intentionally lightweight: a frozen series of predictions + realized
returns + a benchmark goes in, a dict of metrics comes out.

PR 177 — known NSE delisting / merger registry.

When a backtest spans 2018-2025, the "today's Nifty 200" universe is
NOT the universe that was tradeable in 2018. Stocks that delisted,
went bankrupt, or got merged out are silently absent — that's
survivorship bias. The model trains only on winners that are still
listed today, then live trading meets the full distribution including
losers, and OOS performance collapses.

This registry maintains a small but expanding list of known NSE
delistings / suspensions / mergers that were tradeable in our backtest
window (2015-present). When ``liquid_universe(as_of_date=...)`` is
called with a date BEFORE the delisting, the symbol is included in
the candidate pool. After the delisting date, it's excluded.

The registry is intentionally hand-curated. Mass-importing yfinance
"delisted" tickers is risky because many are actually renames/rebrands
that survive under a new symbol. Each entry below should be checked
against NSE corporate actions before being added.

Format:
    DELISTED_NSE: list of (symbol, delisting_date_iso, reason).

When updating:
    - Use ISO YYYY-MM-DD for date.
    - reason ∈ {"bankruptcy", "merger_acquired", "voluntary", "suspension", "scheme"}.
    - For merged-out symbols, reason="merger_acquired" — the symbol no
      longer trades but the company continues under the acquirer.

This file is meant to grow as we audit more historical NSE data.
